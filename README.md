My implementation of algorithms for Coursera's Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

#### 1. A Plus B 
Adds two numbers and returns the result (Max time used: 0.01/1.00, max memory used: 9580544/536870912)

#### 2. Maximum Pairwise Product 
Returns the product of the two largest integers in an array (Max time used: 0.08/1.00, max memory used: 22851584/536870912.)

#### 3. Fibonacci
Returns the nth Fibonacci number (Max time used: 0.00/1.00, max memory used: 9629696/536870912.)

#### 4. Fibonacci Last Digit
Returns the last digit of the nth fibonacci number (Max time used: 0.00/1.00, max memory used: 9588736/536870912.)

#### 5. Greatest Common Divisor (gcd)
Returns the gcd of any two numbers (Max time used: 0.01/1.00, max memory used: 9895936/536870912.)

#### 6. Least Common Multiple (lcm)
Returns the lcm of any two numbers (Max time used: 0.05/1.00, max memory used: 9928704/536870912.)

#### 7. Fibonacci Huge
Return Fn mod m where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number. n can be as large as 10^18 and m is at most 10^3. (Max time used: 0.02/1.00, max memory used: 9912320/536870912.)

#### 8. Last Digit of Sum of Fibonacci Numbers
Return the last digit of sum of fibonacci numbers up to any n, where n can be as large as 10^18. (Max time used: 0.00/1.00, max memory used: 9609216/536870912.)

#### 9. Last digit of the Partial Sum of Fibonacci Numbers
Return the last digit of a partial sum of fibonacci numbers from m to n, where both can be as large as 10^18 (Max time used: 0.01/1.00, max memory used: 9609216/536870912.)
